\begin{abstract}
We present our results of the evaluation of the open source tool \textit{KNIME} which is used for data analytics and data mining. We choose anomaly detection as the subject to evaluate \textit{KNIME} as many methods of data analytics such as clustering, classification, time series analysis and statistical techniques are applicable to anomaly detection \cite{Chandola:2009:ADS:1541880.1541882}. As a data set for the analysis we use the data provided for the \textit{DEBS Grand Challenge 2012} \cite{Jerzak:2012:DGC:2335484.2335536}.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
For the evaluation of \textit{KNIME} we first investigated the tool by following several white-papers provided by \textit{KNIME}. We start with describing the functionalities and the usage of \textit{KNIME}. Then we explain the data used for the evaluation. Subsequently we provide an overview on anomaly detection based on \cite{Chandola:2009:ADS:1541880.1541882}. In Section~\ref{sec:ADwK} we evaluate \textit{KNIME} through applying anomaly detection on the data set described in Section~\ref{sec:D2012GC}.

\subsection{The Open Source Tool KNIME}
In this section we give an overview on \textit{KNIME} based on three white-papers provided by \textit{KNIME}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Big Data, Smart Energy, and Predictive Analytics
\item Anomaly Detection in Predictive Maintenance
\item KNIME opens the Doors to Big Data
\end{itemize}

\textbf{TODOS:}
\begin{itemize}
\item General features of \textit{KNIME} $\rightarrow$ what can you do with \textit{KNIME} (ETL, Mining, Analysis, Visualization etc.)
\item How to use \textit{KNIME}? $\rightarrow$ Workflows, Nodes, ... (describe the usage of \textit{KNIME} in general)
\item Example workflow(s) based on the \textit{KNIME} white-papers
\item Overview on the nodes that are available and name, that there is an API to develop your own nodes
\item Tiny summary (2 sentences) if possible
\end{itemize}

\subsection{DEBS 2012 Grand Challenge}
\label{sec:D2012GC}

\textbf{TODOS:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe the challenge / the origin of the data
\item Explain the data set
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Anomaly Detection}
Anomalies in data are patterns which do not conform to the expected behavior and anomaly detections deals with finding this patterns \cite{Chandola:2009:ADS:1541880.1541882}. There are many techniques that can be applied to detect anomalies. Subsequently we describe classification based, nearest neighbor based and clustering based techniques as well as statistical anomaly detection techniques.

\section{Anomaly Detection with KNIME}
\label{sec:ADwK}

\textbf{TODOS:}
\begin{itemize}
\item How to input the big files into \textit{KNIME}? $\rightarrow$ Split files and iterate over them, input into MySQL etc.
\item Describe the ETL process with \textit{KNIME} of the data
\item Describe how to do anomaly detection with \textit{KNIME}
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
\textbf{TODOS:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{KNIME} is not directly suitable for Big Data Processing
\item Easy tool to do advanced data analytics without deep knowledge of underlying algorithms and math
\item Enables users which are no data scientists or have a strong background in this field to do data analysis
\item Good integration with various other tools (R, Weka) and adoptable to own needs with Java, Python, ... snippet nodes and the API to create own nodes
\item Relatively slow
\end{itemize}
