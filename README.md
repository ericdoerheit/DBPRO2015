# DBPRO2015: Data Analytics using KNIME open source tool

The Database Project 2015 is a course at TU Berlin. The objective of our group (Dorothea Poljak, Olga Bode and Eric DÃ¶rheit supervised by Dr. Marcela Charfuelan) was to use the open source tool KNIME for solving a problem of data analytics. We have chosen the problem of Anomaly Detection and we have made use of the data provided at the DEBS 2012 Grand Challenge (http://www.csw.inf.fu-berlin.de/debs2012/grandchallenge.html).

This repository provides our report as well as the workflows built with KNIME.
